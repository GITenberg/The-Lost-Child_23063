      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On that morning, which was the morning before Christmas, two important
      events happened simultaneously&mdash;the sun rose, and so did M.
      Jean-Baptiste Godefroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unquestionably the sun, illuminating suddenly the whole of Paris with its
      morning rays, is an old friend regarded with affection by everybody, It is
      particularly welcome after a fortnight of misty atmosphere and gray skies,
      when the wind has cleared the air and allowed the sun's rays to reach the
      earth again. Besides all of which the sun is a person of importance.
      Formerly, he was regarded as a god, and was called Osiris, Apollyon, and I
      don't know what else. But do not imagine that because the sun is so
      important he is of greater influence than M. Jean-Baptiste Godefroy,
      millionaire banker, director of the <i>Comptoir Général de Crédit</i>,
      administrator of several big companies, deputy and member of the General
      Counsel of the Eure, officer of the Legion of Honor, etc., etc. And
      whatever opinion the sun may have about himself, he certainly has not a
      higher opinion than M. Jean-Baptiste Godefroy has of <i>him</i>self. So we
      are authorized to state, and we consider ourselves justified in stating,
      that on the morning in question, at about a quarter to eight, the sun and
      M. Jean-Baptiste Godefroy rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly the manner of rising of these two great powers mentioned was not
      the same. The good old sun began by doing a great many pretty actions. As
      the sleet had, during the night, covered the bare branches of the trees in
      the boulevard Malesherbes, where the <i>hôtel</i> Godefroy is situated,
      with a powdered coating, the great magician sun amused himself by
      transforming the branches into great bouquets of red coral. At the same
      time he scattered his rays impartially on those poor passers-by whom
      necessity sent out, so early in the morning, to gain their daily bread, He
      even had a smile for the poor clerk, who, in a thin overcoat, was hurrying
      to his office, as well as for the <i>grisette</i>, shivering under her
      thin, insufficient clothing; for the workman carrying half a loaf under
      his arm, for the car-conductor as he punched the tickets, and for the
      dealer in roast chestnuts, who was roasting his first panful. In short,
      the sun gave pleasure to everybody in the world. M. Jean-Baptiste
      Godefroy, on the contrary, rose in quite a different frame of mind. On the
      previous evening he had dined with the Minister for Agriculture. The
      dinner, from the removal of the <i>potage</i> to the salad, bristled with
      truffles, and the banker's stomach, aged forty-seven years, experienced
      the burning and biting of pyrosis. So the manner in which M. Jean-Baptiste
      Godefroy rang for his valet-de-chambre was so expressive that, as he got
      some warm water for his master's shaving, Charles said to the
      kitchen-maid:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There he goes! The monkey is barbarously ill-tempered again this morning.
      My poor Gertrude, we're going to have a miserable day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon, walking on tiptoe, with eyes modestly cast down, he entered the
      chamber of his master, opened the curtains, lit the fire, and made all the
      necessary preparations for the toilet with the discreet demeanor and
      respectful gestures of a sacristan placing the sacred vessels on the altar
      for the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of weather this morning?" demanded M. Godefroy curtly, as he
      buttoned his undervest of gray swandown upon a stomach that was already a
      little too prominent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very cold, sir," replied Charles meekly. "At six o'clock the thermometer
      marked seven degrees above zero. But, as you will see, sir, the sky is
      quite clear, and I think we are going to have a fine morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      In stropping his razor, M. Godefroy approached the window, drew aside one
      of the hangings, looked on the boulevard, which was bathed in brightness,
      and made a slight grimace which bore some resemblance to a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is all very well to be perfectly stiff and correct, and to know that it
      is bad taste to show feeling of any kind in the presence of domestics, but
      the appearance of the roguish sun in the middle of December sends such a
      glow of warmth to the heart that it is impossible to disguise the fact. So
      M. Godefroy deigned, as before observed, to smile. If some one had
      whispered to the opulent banker that his smile had anything in common with
      that of the printer's boy, who was enjoying himself by making a slide on
      the pavement, M. Godefroy would have been highly incensed. But it really
      was so all the same; and during the space of one minute this man who was
      so occupied by business matters, this leading light in the financial and
      political worlds, indulged in the childish pastime of watching the
      passers-by, and following with his eyes the files of conveyances as they
      gaily rolled in the sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But pray do not be alarmed. Such a weakness could not last long. People of
      no account, and those who have nothing to do, may be able to let their
      time slip by in doing nothing. It is very well for women, children, poets,
      and riffraff. M. Godefroy had other fish to fry; and the work of the day
      which was commencing promised to be exceptionally heavy. From half-past
      eight to ten o'clock he had a meeting at his office with a certain number
      of gentlemen, all of whom bore a striking resemblance to M. Godefroy. Like
      him, they were very nervous; they had risen with the sun, they were all <i>blasés</i>,
      and they all had the same object in view&mdash;to gain money. After
      breakfast (which he took after the meeting), M. Godefroy had to leap into
      his carriage and rush to the Bourse, to exchange a few words with other
      gentlemen who had also risen at dawn, but who had not the least spark of
      imagination among them. (The conversations were always on the same subject&mdash;money.)
      From there, without losing an instant, M. Godefroy went to preside over
      another meeting of acquaintances entirely void of compassion and
      tenderness. The meeting was held round a baize-covered table, which was
      strewn with heaps of papers and well provided with ink-wells. The
      conversation again turned on money, and various methods of gaining it.
      After the aforesaid meeting he, in his capacity of deputy, had to appear
      before several commissions (always held in rooms where there were
      baize-covered tables and ink-wells and heaps of papers). There he found
      men as devoid of sentiment as he was, all utterly incapable of neglecting
      any occasion of gaining money, but who, nevertheless, had the extreme
      goodness to sacrifice several hours of the afternoon to the glory of
      France.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having quickly shaved he donned a morning suit, the elegant cut and
      finish of which showed that the old beau of nearly fifty had not ceased
      trying to please. When he shaved he spared the narrow strip of
      pepper-and-salt beard round his chin, as it gave him the air of a
      trust-worthy family man in the eyes of the Arrogants and of fools in
      general. Then he descended to his cabinet, where he received the file of
      men who were entirely occupied by one thought&mdash;that of augmenting
      their capital. These gentlemen discussed several projected enterprises,
      all of them of considerable importance, notably that of a new railroad to
      be laid across a wild desert. Another scheme was for the founding of
      monster works in the environs of Paris, another of a mine to be worked in
      one of the South American republics. It goes without saying that no one
      asked if the railway would have passengers or goods to carry, or if the
      proposed works should manufacture cotton nightcaps or distil whisky;
      whether the mine was to be of virgin gold or of second-rate copper:
      certainly not. The conversation of M. Godefroy's morning callers turned
      exclusively upon the profits which it would be possible to realize during
      the week which should follow the issue of the shares. They discussed
      particularly the values of the shares, which they knew would be destined
      before long to be worth less than the paper on which they were printed in
      fine style.
    </p>
    <p>
      These conversations, bristling with figures, lasted till ten o'clock
      precisely, and then the director of the <i>Comptoir Général de Crédit</i>,
      who, by the way, was an honest man&mdash;at least, as honest as is to be
      found in business&mdash;courteously conducted his last visitor to the head
      of the stairway. The visitor named was an old villain, as rich as Croesus,
      who, by a not uncommon chance, enjoyed the general esteem of the public;
      whereas, had justice been done to him, he would have been lodging at the
      expense of the State in one of those large establishments provided by a
      thoughtful government for smaller delinquents; and there he would have
      pursued a useful and healthy calling for a lengthy period, the exact
      length having been fixed by the judges of the supreme court. But M.
      Godefroy showed him out relentlessly, notwithstanding his importance&mdash;it
      was absolutely necessary to be at the Bourse at 11 o'clock&mdash;and went
      into the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a luxuriously furnished room. The furniture and plate would have
      served to endow a cathedral. Nevertheless, notwithstanding that M.
      Godefroy took a gulp of bicarbonate of soda, his indigestion refused to
      subside, consequently the banker could only take the scantiest breakfast&mdash;that
      of a dyspeptic. In the midst of such luxury, and under the eye of a
      well-paid butler, M. Godefroy could only eat a couple of boiled eggs and
      nibble a little mutton chop. The man of money trifled with dessert&mdash;took
      only a crumb of Roquefort&mdash;not more than two cents' worth. Then the
      door opened and an overdressed but charming little child&mdash;young
      Raoul, four years old&mdash;the son of the company director, entered the
      room, accompanied by his German nursery governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      This event occurred every day at the same hour&mdash;a quarter to eleven,
      precisely, while the carriage which was to take the banker to the Bourse
      was awaiting the gentleman who had only a quarter of an hour to give to
      paternal sentiment. It was not that he did not love his son. He did love
      him&mdash;nay, he adored him, in his own particular way. But then, you
      know, business <i>is</i> business.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of forty-two, when already worldly-wise and <i>blasé</i>, he
      had fancied himself in love with the daughter of one of his club friends&mdash;Marquis
      de Neufontaine, an old rascal&mdash;a nobleman, but one whose card-playing
      was more than open to suspicion, and who would have been expelled from the
      club more than once but for the influence of M. Godefroy, The nobleman was
      only too happy to become the father-in-law of a man who would pay his
      debts, and without any scruples he handed over his daughter&mdash;a simple
      and ingenuous child of seventeen, who was taken from a convent to be
      married&mdash;to the worldly banker. The girl was certainly sweet and
      pretty, but she had no dowry except numerous aristocratic prejudices and
      romantic illusions, and her father thought he was fortunate in getting rid
      of her on such favorable terms. M. Godefroy, who was the son of an avowed
      old miser of Andelys, had always remained a man of the people, and
      intensely vulgar. In spite of his improved circumstances, he had not
      improved. His entire lack of tact and refinement was painful to his young
      wife, whose tenderest feelings he ruthlessly and thoughtlessly trampled
      upon. Things were looking unpromising, when, happily for her, Madame
      Godefroy died in giving birth to her firstborn. When he spoke of his
      deceased wife, the banker waxed poetical, although had she lived they
      would have been divorced in six months. His son he loved dearly for
      several reasons&mdash;first, because the child was an only son; secondly,
      because he was a scion of two such houses as Godefroy and Neufontaine;
      finally, because the man of money had naturally great respect for the heir
      to many millions. So the youngster had golden rattles and other similar
      toys, and was brought up like a young Dauphin. But his father, overwhelmed
      with business worries, could never give the child more than fifteen
      minutes per day of his precious time&mdash;and, as on the day mentioned,
      it was always during "cheese"&mdash;and for the rest of the day the father
      abandoned the child to the care of the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Raoul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, papa."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the company director, having put his serviette away, sat young Raoul
      on his left knee, took the child's head between his big paws, and in
      stroking and kissing it actually forgot all his money matters and even his
      note of the afternoon, which was of great importance to him, as by it he
      could gain quite an important amount of patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Papa," said little Raoul suddenly, "will Father Christmas put anything in
      my shoe tonight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The father answered with "Yes, if you are a good child." This was very
      striking from a man who was a pronounced freethinker, who always applauded
      every anti-clerical attack in the Chamber with a vigorous "Hear, hear." He
      made a mental note that he must buy some toys for his child that very
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to the nursery governess with:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you quite satisfied with Raoul, Mademoiselle Bertha?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Bertha became as red as a peony at being addressed, as if the
      question were scarcely <i>comme il faut</i>, and replied by a little
      imbecile snigger, which seemed fully to satisfy M. Godefroy's curiosity
      about his son's conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's fine to-day," said the financier, "but cold. If you take Raoul to
      Monceau Park, mademoiselle, please be careful to wrap him up well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle, by a second fit of idiotic smiling, having set at rest M.
      Godefroy's doubts and fears on that essential point, he kissed his child,
      left the room hastily, and in the hall was enveloped in his fur coat by
      Charles, who also closed the carriage door. Then the faithful fellow went
      off to the café which he frequented, Rue de Miromesnil, where he had
      promised to meet the coachman of the baroness who lived opposite, to play
      a game of billiards, thirty up&mdash;and spot-barred, of course.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Thanks to the brown bay&mdash;for which a thousand francs over and above
      its value was paid by M. Godefroy as a result of a sumptuous snail supper
      given to that gentleman's coachman by the horse-dealer&mdash;thanks to the
      expensive brown bay which certainly went well, the financier was able to
      get through his many engagements satisfactorily. He appeared punctually at
      the Bourse, sat at several committee tables, and at a quarter to five, by
      voting with the ministry, he helped to reassure France and Europe that the
      rumors of a ministerial crisis had been totally unfounded. He voted with
      the ministry because he had succeeded in obtaining the favors which he
      demanded as the price of his vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had thus nobly fulfilled his duty to himself and his country, M.
      Godefroy remembered what he had said to his child on the subject of Father
      Christmas, and gave his coachman the address of a dealer in toys. There he
      bought, and had put in his carriage, a fantastic rocking-horse, mounted on
      casters&mdash;a whip in each ear; a box of leaden soldiers&mdash;all as
      exactly alike as those grenadiers of the Russian regiment of the time of
      Paul I, who all had black hair and snub noses; and a score of other toys,
      all equally striking and costly. Then, as he returned home, softly
      reposing in his well-swung carriage, the rich banker, who, after all, was
      a father, began to think with pride of his little boy and to form plans
      for his future.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the child grew up he should have an education worthy of a prince, and
      he would be one, too, for there was no longer any aristocracy except that
      of money, and his boy would have a capital of about 80,000,000 francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If his father, a pettifogging provincial lawyer, who had formerly dined in
      the Latin Quarter when in Paris, who had remarked every evening when
      putting on a white tie that he looked as fine as if he were going to a
      wedding&mdash;if he had been able to accumulate an enormous fortune, and
      to become thereby a power in the republic; if he had been able to obtain
      in marriage a young lady, one of whose ancestors had fallen at Marignano,
      what an important personage little Raoul might become. M. Godefroy built
      all sorts of air-castles for his boy, forgetting that Christmas is the
      birthday of a very poor little child, son of a couple of vagrants, born in
      a stable, where the parents only found lodging through charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the banker's dreams the coachman cried: "Door, please,"
      and drove into the yard. As he went up the steps M. Godefroy was thinking
      that he had barely time to dress for dinner; but on entering the vestibule
      he found all the domestics crowded in front of him in a state of alarm and
      confusion. In a corner, crouching on a seat, was the German
      nursery-governess, crying. When she saw the banker she buried her face in
      her hands and wept still more copiously than before. M. Godefroy felt that
      some misfortune had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the meaning of all this? What's amiss? What has happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles, the <i>valet de chambre</i>, a sneaking rascal of the worst type,
      looked at his master with eyes full of pity and stammered: "Mr. Raoul&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lost, sir. The stupid German did it. Since four o'clock this afternoon he
      has not been seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      The father staggered back like one who had been hit by a ball. The German
      threw herself at his feet, screaming: "Mercy, mercy!" and the domestics
      all spoke at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bertha didn't go to <i>parc Monceau</i>. She lost the child over there on
      the fortifications. We have sought him all over, sir. We went to the
      office for you, sir, and then to the Chamber, but you had just left. Just
      imagine, the German had a rendezvous with her lover every day, beyond the
      ramparts, near the gate of Asnières. What a shame! It is a place full of
      low gipsies and strolling players. Perhaps the child has been stolen. Yes,
      sir, we informed the police at once. How could we imagine such a thing? A
      hypocrite, that German! She had a rendezvous, doubtless, with a countryman&mdash;a
      Prussian spy, sure enough!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His son lost! M. Godefroy seemed to have a torrent of blood rushing
      through his head. He sprang at Mademoiselle, seized her by the arms and
      shook her furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you lose him, you miserable girl? Tell me the truth before I
      shake you to pieces. Do you hear? Do you hear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the unfortunate girl could only cry and beg for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banker tried to be calm. No, it was impossible. Nobody would dare to
      steal <i>his</i> boy. Somebody would find him and bring him back. Of that
      there could be no doubt. He could scatter money about right and left, and
      could have the entire police force at his orders. And he would set to work
      at once, for not an instant should be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles, don't let the horses be taken out. You others, see that this
      girl doesn't escape. I'm going to the Prefecture."
    </p>
    <p>
      And M. Godefroy, with his heart thumping against his sides as if it would
      break them, his hair wild with fright, darted into his carriage, which at
      once rolled off as fast as the horses could take it. What irony! The
      carriage was full of glittering playthings, which sparkled every time a
      gaslight shone on them. For the next day was the birthday of the divine
      Infant at whose cradle wise men and simple shepherds alike adored.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor little Raoul! Poor darling! Where is my boy?" repeated the father
      as in his anguish he dug his nails into the cushions of the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment all his titles and decorations, his honors, his millions,
      were valueless to him. He had one single idea burning in his brain. "My
      poor child! Where is my child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he reached the Prefecture of Police. But no one was there&mdash;the
      office had been deserted for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am M. Godefroy, deputy from L'Eure&mdash;My little boy is lost in
      Paris; a child of four years. I must see the Prefect." He slipped a louis
      into the hand of the <i>concierge</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good old soul, a veteran with a gray mustache, less for the sake of
      the money than out of compassion for the poor father, led him to the
      Prefect's private apartments. M. Godefroy was finally ushered into the
      room of the man in whom were centred all his hopes. He was in evening
      dress, and wore a monocle; his manner was frigid and rather pretentious.
      The distressed father, whose knees trembled through emotion, sank into an
      armchair, and, bursting into tears, told of the loss of his boy&mdash;told
      the story stammeringly and with many breaks, for his voice was choked by
      sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prefect, who was also father of a family, was inwardly moved at the
      sight of his visitor's grief, but he repressed his emotion and assumed a
      cold and self-important air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say, sir, that your child has been missing since four o'clock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just when night was falling, confound it. He isn't at all precocious,
      speaks very little, doesn't know where he lives, and can't even pronounce
      his own name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unfortunately that is so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not far from Asnières gate? A suspected quarter. But cheer up. We have a
      very intelligent <i>Commissaire de Police</i> there. I'll telephone to
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The distressed father was left alone for five minutes. How his temples
      throbbed and his heartbeat!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly, the Prefect reappeared, smiling with satisfaction.
      "Found!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon M. Godefroy rushed to the Prefect, whose hand he pressed till
      that functionary winced with the pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must acknowledge that we were exceedingly fortunate. The little chap is
      blond, isn't he? Rather pale? In blue velvet? Black felt hat, with a white
      feather in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; that's he. That's my little Raoul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he's at the house of a poor fellow down in that quarter who had
      just been at the police office to make his declaration to the Commissaire.
      Here's his address, which I took down: '<i>Pierron, rue des Cailloux,
      Levaïlois-Perret</i>.' With good horses you may reach your boy in less
      than an hour. Certainly, you won't find him in an aristocratic quarter;
      his surroundings won't be of the highest. The man who found him is only a
      small dealer in vegetables."
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was of no importance to M. Godefroy, who, having expressed his
      gratitude to the Prefect, leaped down the stairs four at a time, and
      sprang into his carriage. At that moment he realized how devotedly he
      loved his child. As he drove away he no longer thought of little Raoul's
      princely education and magnificent inheritance. He was decided never again
      to hand over the child entirely to the hands of servants, and he also made
      up his mind to devote less time to monetary matters and the glory of
      France and attend more to his own. The thought also occurred to him that
      France wouldn't be likely to suffer from the neglect. He had hitherto been
      ashamed to recognize the existence of an old-maid sister of his father,
      but he decided to send for her to his house. She would certainly shock his
      lackeys by her primitive manners and ideas. But what of that? She would
      take care of his boy, which to him was of much more importance than the
      good opinion of his servants. The financier, who was always in a hurry,
      never felt so eager to arrive punctually at a committee meeting as he was
      to reach the lost little one. For the first time in his life he was
      longing through pure affection to take the child in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage rolled rapidly along in the clear, crisp night air down
      boulevard Malesherbes; and, having crossed the ramparts and passed the
      large houses, plunged into the quiet solitude of suburban streets. When
      the carriage stopped M. Godefroy saw a wretched hovel, on which was the
      number he was seeking; it was the house where Pierron lived. The door of
      the house opened immediately, and a big, rough-looking fellow with red
      mustache appeared. One of his sleeves was empty. Seeing the gentleman in
      the carriage, Pierron said cheerily: "So you are the little one's father.
      Don't be afraid. The little darling is quite safe," and, stepping aside in
      order to allow M. Godefroy to pass, he placed his finger on his lips with:
      "Hush! The little one is asleep!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was a real hovel. By the dim light of a little oil lamp M.
      Godefroy could just distinguish a dresser from which a drawer was missing,
      some broken chairs, a round table on which stood a beer-mug which was half
      empty, three glasses, some cold meat on a plate, and on the bare plaster
      of the wall two gaudy pictures&mdash;a bird's-eye view of the Exposition
      of 1889, with the Eiffel Tower in bright blue, and the portrait of General
      Boulanger when a handsome young lieutenant. This last evidence of weakness
      of the tenant of the house may well be excused, since it was shared by
      nearly everybody in France. The man took the lamp and went on tiptoe to
      the corner of the room where, on a clean bed, two little fellows were fast
      asleep. In the little one, around whom the other had thrown a protecting
      arm, M. Godefroy recognized his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The youngsters were tired to death, and so sleepy," said Pierron, trying
      to soften his rough voice. "I had no idea when you would come, so gave
      them some supper and put them to bed, and then I went to make a
      declaration at the police office. Zidore generally sleeps up in the
      garret, but I thought they would be better here, and that I should be
      better able to watch them."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Godefroy, however, scarcely heard the explanation. Strangely moved, he
      looked at the two sleeping infants on an iron bedstead and covered with an
      old blanket which had once been used either in barracks or hospital.
      Little Raoul, who was still in his velvet suit, looked so frail and
      delicate compared with his companion that the banker almost envied the
      latter his brown complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he your boy?" he asked Pierron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," answered he. "I am a bachelor, and don't suppose I shall ever marry,
      because of my accident. You see, a dray passed over my arm&mdash;that was
      all. Two years ago a neighbor of mine died, when that child was only five
      years old. The poor mother really died of starvation. She wove wreaths for
      the cemeteries, but could make nothing worth mentioning at that trade&mdash;not
      enough to live. However, she worked for the child for five years, and then
      the neighbors had to buy wreaths for her. So I took care of the youngster.
      Oh, it was nothing much, and I was soon repaid. He is seven years old, and
      is a sharp little fellow, so he helps me a great deal. On Sundays and
      Thursdays, and the other days after school, he helps me push my handcart.
      Zidore is a smart little chap. It was he who found your boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" exclaimed M. Godefroy&mdash;"that child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he's quite a little man, I assure you. When he left school he found
      your child, who was walking on ahead, crying like a fountain. He spoke to
      him and comforted him, like an old grandfather. The difficulty is, that
      one can't easily understand what your little one says&mdash;English words
      are mixed up with German and French. So we couldn't get much out of him,
      nor could we learn his address. Zidore brought him to me&mdash;I wasn't
      far away; and then all the old women in the place came round chattering
      and croaking like so many frogs, and all full of advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Take him to the police,'" said some.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Zidore protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would scare him," said he, for like all Parisians, he has no
      particular liking for the police&mdash; "and besides, your little one
      didn't wish to leave him. So I came back here with the child as soon as I
      could. They had supper, and then off to bed. Don't they look sweet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was in his carriage, M. Godefroy had decided to reward the finder
      of his child handsomely&mdash;to give him a handful of that gold so easily
      gained. Since entering the house he had seen a side of human nature with
      which he was formerly unacquainted&mdash;the brave charity of the poor in
      their misery. The courage of the poor girl who had worked herself to death
      weaving wreaths to keep her child; the generosity of the poor cripple in
      adopting the orphan, and above all, the intelligent goodness of the little
      street Arab in protecting the child who was still smaller than himself&mdash;all
      this touched M. Godefroy deeply and set him reflecting. For the thought
      had occurred to him that there were other cripples who needed to be looked
      after as well as Pierron, and other orphans as well as Zidore. He also
      debated whether it would not be better to employ his time looking after
      them, and whether money might not be put to a better use than merely
      gaining money. Such was his reverie as he stood looking at the two
      sleeping children. Finally, he turned round to study the features of the
      greengrocer, and was charmed by the loyal expression in the face of the
      man, and his clear, truthful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend," said M. Godefroy, "you and your adopted son have rendered me
      an immense service. I shall soon prove to you that I am not ungrateful.
      But, for to-day&mdash;I see that you are not in comfortable circumstances,
      and I should like to leave a small proof of my thankfulness."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the hand of the cripple arrested that of the banker, which was diving
      into his coat-pocket where he kept bank-notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; no! Anybody else should have done just as we have done. I will
      not accept any recompense; but pray don't take offense. Certainly, I am
      not rolling in wealth, but please excuse my pride&mdash;that of an old
      soldier; I have the Tonquin medal&mdash;and I don't wish to eat food which
      I haven't earned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you like," said the financier; "but an old soldier like you is capable
      of something better. You are too good to push a handcart. I will make some
      arrangement for you, never fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cripple responded by a quiet smile, and said coldly: "Well, sir, if
      you really wish to do something for me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll let me care for Zidore, won't you?" cried M. Godefroy, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I will, with the greatest of pleasure," responded Pierron, joyfully.
      "I have often, thought about the child's future. He is a sharp little
      fellow. His teachers are delighted with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Pierron suddenly stopped, and an expression came over his face which
      M. Godefroy at once interpreted as one of distrust. The thought evidently
      was: "Oh, when he has once left us he'll forget us entirely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can safely pick the child up in your arms and take him to the
      carriage. He'll be better at home than here, of course. Oh, you needn't be
      afraid of disturbing him. He is fast asleep, and you can just pick him up.
      He must have his shoes on first, though."
    </p>
    <p>
      Following Pierron's glance M. Godefroy perceived on the hearth, where a
      scanty coke fire was dying out, two pairs of children's shoes;&mdash;the
      elegant ones of Raoul, and the rough ones of Zidore. Each pair contained a
      little toy and a package of bonbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think about that," said Pierron in an abashed tone. "Zidore put the
      shoes there. You know children still believe in Christmas and the child
      Jesus, whatever scholars may say about fables; so, as I came back from the
      <i>commissaire</i>, as I didn't know whether your boy would have to stay
      here to-night, I got those things for them both."
    </p>
    <p>
      At which the eyes of M. Godefroy, the freethinker, the hardened
      capitalist, and <i>blasé</i> man of the world, filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed out of the house, but returned in a minute with his arms full of
      the superb mechanical horse, the box of leaden soldiers, and the rest of
      the costly playthings bought by him in the afternoon, and which had not
      even been taken out of the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, my dear friend," said he to the greengrocer, "see, these are
      the presents which Christmas has brought to my little Raoul. I want him to
      find them here, when he awakens, and to share them with Zidore, who will
      henceforth be his playmate and friend. You'll trust me now, won't you?
      I'll take care both of Zidore and of you, and then I shall ever remain in
      your debt, for not only have you found my boy, but you have also reminded
      me, who am rich and lived only for myself, that there are other poor who
      need to be looked after. I swear by these two sleeping children, I won't
      forget them any longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the miracle which happened on the 24th of December of last year,
      ladies and gentlemen, at Paris, in the full flow of modern egotism. It
      doesn't sound likely&mdash;that I own; and I am compelled to attribute
      this miraculous event to the influence of the Divine Child who came down
      to earth nearly nineteen centuries ago to command men to love one another.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
